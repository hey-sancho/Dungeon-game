Dungeon Game v. 0.1

General info
------------

It is a text-based FPS dungeon-exploration game being written in Python 2.7.1 with curses module.
It is in a very early version, but the main features will be:

- Text-based gaming, so you can play without graphics in a 80x24 terminal screen
- Mostly first person experience, along with top-down view on the map. It is going to be like FPS version of Nethack
- Dungeons, treasures, chests, monsters, skeletons, etc. Not only on the map but in ascii art in first person view too.
- Different textures of walls, floor, ceiling in different levels/locations
- Maybe color version of these
- Some kind of AI
- Maybe multiplayer
- Maybe inventory and character generation
- Everything else that is awesome

Have to say that i haven't decided in which setting will it be. It could be space corridors or stony rocky grimy dungeons, or both :)

What's new
----------

- Drawing functions for walls, ceiling and floor.
- Moving player around map with arrow keys

Hardware & Software requirements
